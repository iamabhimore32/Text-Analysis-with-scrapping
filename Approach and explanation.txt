1.Extracting Article Text from URL:
    - We'll use a Python library like `requests` to fetch the HTML content of the webpage.
    - Then, we'll use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the relevant article text (usually within `<p>` tags).

2. Text Analysis:
    - We'll perform various text analysis tasks on the extracted article text.
    - The NLTK library will be helpful for tasks like tokenization, sentence splitting, and calculating readability metrics.

3. Output Variables:
    - We'll compute the following output variables:
        - Positive Score: Sentiment score indicating positive sentiment.
        - Negative Score: Sentiment score indicating negative sentiment.
        - Polarity Score: Overall sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
        - Subjectivity Score: Measure of how subjective the text is.
        - Average Sentence Length: Average number of words per sentence.
        - Percentage of Complex Words: Ratio of complex words to total words.
        - FOG Index: Readability index based on sentence length and complex words.
        - Average Number of Words per Sentence: Self-explanatory.
        - Complex Word Count: Number of complex words.
        - Word Count: Total number of words.
        - Syllables per Word: Average number of syllables per word.
        - Personal Pronouns: Count of personal pronouns (e.g., "I," "you," "he," etc.).
        - Average Word Length: Self-explanatory.

Dependencies:

1. Python Libraries:
    -requests`: For making HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.
    -BeautifulSoup`: For parsing HTML content.
    -nltk`: For natural language processing tasks (tokenization, sentiment analysis, etc.).
    -pandas`: For data manipulation (optional, if you want to store results in a DataFrame).
